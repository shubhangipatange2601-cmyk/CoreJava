   what are loops?
   It is a block of code which will repeat until certain conditions are true.

   Types of Loop in java?
   1) For loop =>
   The for loop in Java is a control flow statement used to repeatedly execute a block of code
   a specified number of times. It is particularly useful when the number of iterations is
   known beforehand.

        int[] array = {10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100}
               //array length = 10
               for(int i = 0; i < array.length; i++){
                       i = 0  0< 10                    //true
                       i = 9  9< 10                    //true
                       i = 10  10< 10                  //false

            system.out.println("element present at index"+i + "is" + array[i];
            }


        //initialisation => where we can start

       // termination-condition => This boolean expression is evaluated before each iteration.
       // If the condition is true, the loop body executes; if false, the loop terminates.

       // Update =>This statement is executed after each iteration of the loop body.
       // It usually modifies the loop control variable
       // (e.g., incrementing or decrementing it).
