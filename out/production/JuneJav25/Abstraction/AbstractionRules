What is Abstraction in Java?
It is a process in which we show only essential parts and hide implementations
details.

 Abstraction => Hiding implementation details and showing only required part.

How do we achieve abstraction?
A) Abstract Class
B) Interface

Abstraction => We have to do something but we don't tell now to do it.


ABSTRACTION RULES=>
Abstract methods are those methods which does not have method body and
it ends with semicolon.

1) It is not mandatory to have abstract method in abstract class.

2) If we define any abstract method in a class then that class must be an abstract
Class.

3) We can not create an object of Abstract class.

4) If one abstract class extends another abstract class, then it's not mandatory
for that child class to provide method implementations of abstract methods of
 super class.

5) In concrete/ Non abstract class extends abstract class, then it's mandatory for
that child class to provide method.

Implementation of abstract methods of super class.

The whole purpose of Abstraction is that some other class must extends that class
and provide methods implementation to the abstract method of abstract class.
