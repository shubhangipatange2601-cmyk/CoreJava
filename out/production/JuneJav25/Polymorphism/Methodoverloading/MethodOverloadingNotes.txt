What is Method overloading in Java?
It is process in which we create methods in same class with same name
but different argument list or different method signature.


What is method signature?
method name + parameter list

void name(String name){
}

Rules:
1) Method signature must be different or method name must be same
but parameter list also be different.
    A) Different number of params
    B) Order of params must be different
    C) Types of params must be different

2) Within same class.
3) return type can be different



1) Same Method Name: Methods must have the same name.
2) Different Parameter Lists: Methods must have different parameter lists, differing in:
        Number of parameters: Different quantities of parameters.
        Types of parameters: Parameters of varying data types.
        Order of parameters: Sequence of data types of parameters differing.
3) Occurs within the same class: Method overloading must occur within the same class.

4) Return Type: The return type can be the same or different.
Changing only the return type is not sufficient for overloading.

5) Access Modifiers: Methods can have different access modifiers
(e.g., public, private, protected).
