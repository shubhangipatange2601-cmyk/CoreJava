What are arrays in Java?
Array in Java is a container object that holds a group or collection of elements of a similar data type.
In other words, an array is a fixed-size data structure that is used to hold more than one value of the
same data type.

It is generally used to store a group of elements (or values) or a collection of related data items
that share a common name.

So, we can store a group of strings, a group of int values, or a group of float values in the array.
But, we cannot store some int values or some float values in the array.

Elements of an array in java are stored in a contiguous memory location.
When the memory space for an array is allocated, the array size must be given (or fixed)
that represents the number of elements.

In short, an array in java is a collection of values of similar data type, stored in the
contiguous memory location, sharing a common name, and distinguished by an element’s index.



Why we need array in Java?
Using an array, we can declare a single variable that can hold all the values.
That is, an array variable of a type can hold as many values of that type as we want.

The advantage of using an array is that we can simplify programming by replacing many statements
with just one or two statements and increasing understanding readability.



    int[] intArray = new  int[10];

        index
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

        size   => 10
        first index = 0
        int[] intArray = new  int[20];     size = 20
        first index = 0
        last index = 19 (size - 1)
