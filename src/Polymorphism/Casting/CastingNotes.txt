What is Casting in java?






Narrowing vs Widening?

Primitive data types?

Upcasting vs DownCasting?

Incompatible data type error?
when two data types are not same and not compatible and gets error then it
is called incompatible data type error.


 ClassName reference  = new ClassName();

  Reference Type      =  object type
    Parent reference  = new Child();   //Upcasting Natural/implicit casting

    Child reference   = new Parent()   //Down casting/explicit casting
   (Down casting will work at runtime, but will fail at runtime)

  implicit vs explicit
