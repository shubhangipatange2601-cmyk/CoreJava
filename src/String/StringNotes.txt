What is String in java?
String is a non-primitive data types because it references a memory location
where data is stored in the heap memory (or string constant pool)

Why should we use String class?
Strings in Java are fundamental for handling and manipulating textual data, offering several
advantages that make them essential for various programming tasks.



why String class is most commonly used in java?
The String class is one of the most commonly used classes in Java due to its fundamental role
in handling and manipulating textual data.


 String immutable
security





1)String is a non-primitive data type.
String size is not fixed.

2)String is the sequence of characters(Array of character)
Char[] c = {'d', 'e','e', 'p','a','k'}  // CharSequence
String 8 = String(c)

3)String is a class
public final class String extends implements charSequence,Serializable,
Comparable.

4)String s = new String();

String is an object=> immutable.

String s = "Deepak "

5) To create Strings there are 3 classes
 String > StringBuffer > StringBuilder

1)Method AREA => 1.6 version=> permgen
2)Heap Area => 1.7 version=> SCP
3)Stack
4)PC Register
5)Native Method Area

string constant pool(SCP) is a special memory location was present in  Heap area which is used to store
string literals.
method area until 1.6 versions but after 1.6
version it was shifted to heap area.

String Constant Pool is not applicable or Garbage collection as JVM internally creates reference
variables for each string literal object.

String s1 = new String("Deepak");   //2 objects
String s2 = new String("Rahul");    //2 objects
String s3 = new String("Deepak");   //1 object
String s4 = new String("amit");     //1 object
String s5 = new String("Deepak");   //0 object


//String Immutability
Immutability means Unchangeable

Immutability concept is used for "String Objects" i.e.String objects are
immutable it means Once Object is created; its data
or state can't be changed but a new string object is created.
