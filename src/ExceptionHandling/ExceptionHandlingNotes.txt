An Exception is an unwanted or unexpected event that occurs during the
execution of a program and disrupts the normal flow of instructions.

Dividing a number by zero

Accessing an array index out of range

Entering invalid input

Opening a file that does not exist


Exception handling is the mechanism used in Java to handle runtime errors
so that the program does not crash and continues its normal flow.

In Java, exceptions are handled using:
✔ try
✔ catch
✔ throw
✔ throws
✔ finally


Error Defination
An error represents a serious issue that occurs in the system (not in the program).
Errors cannot be handled by the programmer.

OutOfMemoryError
StackOverflowError

these are caused by system failure, memory issues, etc.

Throwable Hierarchy Definition
In Java, Throwable is the parent class for all errors and exceptions.
          Object
             |
         Throwable
         /        \
     Error      Exception
                   |
           RuntimeException


A runtime exception is an exception that occurs at runtime
(during program execution) and the compiler does NOT force you to handle it.

Examples:
ArithmeticException
NullPointerException
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

A checked exception is an exception that must be handled at compile-time
using try-catch or throws.
If not handled, the program will NOT compile.

Examples:
IOException
SQLException
ClassNotFoundException

| **Error**                                                  | **Exception**                               |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Represents serious problems in the system environment.     | Represents problems in the program.         |
| Cannot be handled by the programmer.                       | Can be handled using try–catch.             |
| Occurs due to system issues. (memory leak, stack overflow) | Occurs due to logical or input mistakes.    |
| Examples: OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError             | Examples: NullPointerException, IOException |


| **Checked Exception**                       | **Unchecked Exception**            |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Checked at compile-time.                    | Checked at runtime.                |
| Must be handled using try–catch or throws.  | No need to compulsorily handle.    |
| Usually from external resources (file, DB). | Caused by coding mistakes.         |
| Examples: IOException, SQLException         | Examples: ArithmeticException, NPE |


| **throw**                                   | **throws**                             |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Used to **manually throw** an exception.    | Used to **declare** an exception.      |
| Inside method body.                         | In method signature.                   |
| Only one exception can be thrown at a time. | Can declare multiple exceptions.       |
| Example: `throw new Exception("error")`     | Example: `void m() throws IOException` |



| Keyword        | Meaning                                                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **final**      | Keyword used to make variable/method/class unchangeable.      |
| **finally**    | Block that always executes (used in exception handling).      |
| **finalize()** | Method called by Garbage Collector before object destruction. |


Unchecked Exception
A custom exception is a user-defined exception created by extending the
Exception class when built-in exceptions do not meet your requirements.

     class AgeInvalidException extends Exception {
         public AgeInvalidException(String msg) {
             super(msg);
         }
     }
